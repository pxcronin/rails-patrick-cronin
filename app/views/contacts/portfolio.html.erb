    <p>I've worked with John's Crazy Socks, a million dollar sock business run on Shopify. I have designed, built, and updated several pages for them including their <a href="https://johnscrazysocks.com/pages/johns-crazy-socks-in-the-media" target="_blank">In The Media</a> and <a href="https://johnscrazysocks.com/pages/shipping" target="_blank">Shipping</a> pages.</p>

    <p>CounterArgument was a site I created with three other developers during my bootcamp with Le Wagon. CounterArgument is a demo site that lets users post short statements that they want to crowdsource counters to or provide counters to short statements posted by others.</p>
